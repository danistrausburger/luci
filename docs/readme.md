PA2 - Luci Lexer Project

Designing and building an interpreter for a programming language. This program is specifically the lexer analysis portion of the interpreter. Our language is called Luci.

This program generates tokens based off of custom-chosen data types and keywords. They are personally defined and customized for our interpreter.

To use this program, one must have Python installed on their machine. Everything else is included in the files.

To use, simply open a new bash terminal and type the following:

python lexer.py < ../example/yourfile

Replace "yourfile" with the name of the file you wish to pass into the lexer.

An example file, called ex.note, is provided with the project files, in the example file..
You may have anything in the inputted file, including but not limited to numbers, operators, and characters.
